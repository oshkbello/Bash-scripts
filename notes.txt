Variable naming conventions

In Bash scripting, the following are the variable naming conventions:
    Variable names should start with a letter or an underscore (_).
    Variable names can contain letters, numbers, and underscores (_).
    Variable names are case-sensitive.
    Variable names should not contain spaces or special characters.
    Use descriptive names that reflect the purpose of the variable.
    Avoid using reserved keywords, such as if, then, else, fi, and so on as variable names.

Here are some examples of valid variable names in Bash:
    name
    count
    _var
    myVar
    MY_VAR

here are some examples of invalid variable names:
    2ndvar (variable name starts with a number)
    my var (variable name contains a space)
    my-var (variable name contains a hyphen)
